# regression_neuralnetworks_code
The MatLab scripts from this repository correspond to the code of my final degree dissertation in mathematics regarding one-hidden layer neural networks.
The scripts are used to create a random sample given a set of points, to implement the neural network described in the dissertation and finally the scripts
solving some regression examples.
